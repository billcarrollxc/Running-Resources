## What does this project do?
This project is designed to be a directory of resources for the runner who is unsure where to look.  It will have the training of elite runners, the writings of elite coaches, and programs (e.g. calculators, etc.) that may make life a little easier.

## Why is this project useful?
This project is useful because it separates good information from the piles of chaff found on the web.  Beginning runners often do not know where to look, become overwhelmed, and fall into some fad that ruins their experience with running.

## How do I get started?
At the moment, I want to keep this project an independent effort as I gain experience with coding/programming.  However, I created and linked below to a Google Form, where you can add suggestions for pages, links, or functionality.  Please, don't hesitate to fill it out.  I welcome your feedback.
