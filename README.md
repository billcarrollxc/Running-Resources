# Please Help
My calculator is broken.  If anyone knows how to fix this, PLEASE HELP ME!!!  I built a calculator in CodePen using HTML, Javascript, and a tiny bit of CSS, and in the transfer over, it broke.  I am at wits end right now.  i have a temporary solution, embedding the pen into my webpage, but it is ungly and merely a shadow of what it could be.  Please contact me and I will give you more details.
